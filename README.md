# Four-bar-mechanism-visualisation-using-python

in this project the working of a four bar mechanism with specific arm lengths can be simulated and exported as mp4 file. This could help us figure out the optimum arm lengths for a specific application also it shows the trajectory followed by the mechanism. This can be used to design legs for quadruped and biped robots , robotic arms and many such projects.
